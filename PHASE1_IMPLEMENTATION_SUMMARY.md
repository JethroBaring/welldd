## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

### **Current Setup (Mock Data):**
```
UI Components → API Functions → Mock Data → UI Display
```

### **Backend Integration Ready:**
All API functions in `/lib/api/` are structured to easily connect to real backend endpoints:

```typescript
// Current: Mock data
export async function getPurchaseRequests() {
  await delay();
  return mockPurchaseRequests;
}

// Future: Backend integration (just replace the function body)
export async function getPurchaseRequests() {
  const response = await axios.get('/api/purchase-requests');
  return response.data;
}
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Installation:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### **Development:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit: `http://localhost:3000`
