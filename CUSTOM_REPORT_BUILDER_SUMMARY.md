  filters: [{
    field: "availableQuantity",
    operator: "less_than",
    value: "reorderLevel"
  }],

  aggregation: "sum(total)"
}
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Type Safety
All report configurations are strongly typed using TypeScript interfaces:

```typescript
interface ReportConfiguration {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  dataSource: DataSourceType;
  selectedFields: string[];
  filters: ReportFilter[];
  visualization: VisualizationType;
  schedule?: ReportSchedule;
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of data sources
- Paginated results (50 records default)
- Debounced filter inputs
- Memoized chart calculations
- Virtual scrolling for large tables

### Security Measures
- Role-based access control
- Field-level permissions
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Audit logging
