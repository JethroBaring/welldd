## **Project Details**

| Project Name: | WellSync \- Dalaguete Rural Health Unit Medical Records and Inventory Management System |
| :---- | :---- |
| Date:\t\t | 10/3/2025 |
| Creator: | HITS Team |
| Version Number: | 1 |

| Project Overview |
| :---- |
| WellSync is a digital platform designed to be the internal inventory and medical record system for the Dalaquete Rural Health Unit. The project aims to replace manual, labor-intensive, and error-prone processes by connecting and automating essential services. The RHU currently faces challenges that impact its ability to deliver optimal services: **Inventory Management** The current process for tracking and counting medicines is manual, labor-intensive, and prone to errors as these are being counted, taken note of and encoded manually which can lead to difficulties in accurate stock counts, managing shelf life, and generating timely reports. The current system relies on manual counting, Excel sheets, and an external system (eLMIS) that is not fully integrated or utilized due to lack of training and outdated data. **Record Archiving** Although they have iClinicSys, it was mentioned by the RHU head that it lacked maintenance and upgrades and they still have a room full of physical folders that are used to store an estimated 70,000 patient medical records and profiles. This manual archiving system makes searching for individual records difficult and time-consuming, and there is a risk of records being lost. **Accreditation and Reporting** The RHU has faced issues with accreditation processes and generating reports for third-party entities like PhilHealth and DOH due to limitations of iclinicsys and a lack of integrated data.  ![][image1] ![][image2] |

Main Screen/Page Displays: List of Pending/Approved/Completed PRs PR Creation Interface (Department Lookup) Supplier lookup Item Lookup for faster medicine search Status Tracker (Requested, Approved, Denied, PO Created) Each Purchase Order (PO) Will Include: PR Number PR Date Requesting Cost Center (e.g., Department, Ward, Program) Supplier Details: Supplier Name, Contact Info, Payment Terms, Tax details Created by and Approved by (User-in-charge) Remarks List of Items Requested (Medicine Name, Quantity, Unit) Functionality Details: Request Initiation: Allows Medical Staff or other RHU personnel to digitally request the purchase of medicines or office supplies. Cost Center Identification: Allows the RHU to identify the requesting department (e.g., Ward A, TB Program, or Admin Office) as a separate cost Center for internal tracking and budget allocation. Approval Workflow: Initiates an automated workflow for the RHU Head or GSO/Admin Staff to review, approve, or deny the request. Procurement Linkage: Approved Purchase Requests automatically feed into the Vendor/Supplier Management (Phase 2\) & PO Generation module to streamline the procure-to-pay process. |
| **PO Generation** |
| This feature enables the GSO/Admin staff to formalize and approve medicine reorders, linking them to defined stock thresholds.  Main Screen/Page Displays: List of Pending PO Drafts/History PO Generation Interface (Supplier Selection) Item Lookup for faster medicine search Inventory Check Status (Stock Order, Pending POs) Reorder Items Button (for items below threshold) Each Purchase Order (PO) Will Include: PO Number (Auto-generated) PO Date Supplier Details: Supplier Name, Contact Info, Payment Terms, Tax details Created By and Approved By Remarks List of Items for Purchase (Medicine Name, Quantity, Unit)  |
| **Warehouse Receiving Report (WRR)** |
| This feature formalizes the receiving process and implements Barcode/QR scanning for medicine stock, enforcing the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) confirming that the physical stock scanned matches the approved Purchase Order. This is a one-time event that happens before the stock is active. It ensures a three-way match (PO, Supplier Delivery Receipt, and Physical Scan) for audit and accounting purposes. Main Screen/Page Displays: List of Posted POs available for Receiving WRR Creation Interface (Link to PO and Barcode Scan) Discrepancy Calculator (Scanned vs. PO Quantity) Inventory Addition Confirmation (based on discrepancy calculation) Each Warehouse Receiving Report (WRR) Will Include: WRR Number (Auto-generated) PO Date PO Number Supplier Name  Supplier Number Total Amount Created by Action button: Receive Order PO Number Location Date Received Received By Items (can also be for barcode scanning) Item Ordered quantity Unit Total received quantity Remaining quantity to receive Expiration date Received quantity Remarks  Recent logs Each PO will consist of the ff details (dropdown): Requisition Slip  Expected delivery Approver(s) Supplier Location Date Received and Received By (GSO Staff) List of Items Received  Item Name Quantity Unit Unit Price Discount% Expiry Date Subtotal Discount Total PO Amount Recent logs Remarks Approval process can either be set to  required or bypassed   |
| **Stock Issuance (consignment from one LGU to another)** |
| This module manages the formal transfer of medicine stock from the originating LGU (Dalaguete RHU) to a receiving LGU. It ensures transparency, minimizes waste from expiration, and formally removes the stock from the WellSync inventory for audit purposes. Main Screen/Page Displays: List of Available Expiring Stock (Filtered by Expiry Date) Transfer Out Generation Interface (Recipient LGU Lookup) Real-time Stock Deduction Confirmation Tracking Status (Draft, Approved, Issued, Received) Print/Export Transfer Manifest Discrepancy Log (Transfer vs. Actual Issue) Each Transfer Out Record (TOR) Will Include: TOR Number (Auto-generated) Date of Issuance/Transfer Transferring LGU (Dalaguete RHU) and Receiving LGU (Name, Contact) Approver(s) (RHU Head, Admin) Total Value of Transferred Stock Each Transfer Item Record Will Include (Linked to TOR): Item Details: Item Name, Item Code Batch Information: Batch/Lot Number, Expiration Date, Remaining Shelf Life Quantity: Quantity Transferred, Quantity Requested Source Data: Original PO/WRR Number (for audit trail) Remarks  on the physical condition of the item upon transfer. Functionality Details and Technical Context: Transfer Initiation: Allows GSO/Admin Staff to create a Transfer Out Record (TOR) by selecting a receiving LGU and pulling data from the Expiring Stock Alerts list (from Stock Monitoring Dashboard). Stock Selection (FEFO Principle): The system ensures that only stock nearing expiry (FEFO logic) is eligible for transfer, with preference given to stock closest to the predetermined expiry alert threshold (e.g., less than 6 months). Item Pull/Issuance: GSO Staff uses the Barcode/QR Scanner to scan the specific medicine batches being pulled for transfer. This action immediately deducts the stock from WellSync's active inventory. Transfer Approval Workflow: Requires approval (e.g., from the RHU Head) before the Transfer Out Record can be finalized and the stock physically moved. This ensures accountability. Transfer Manifest Generation: Automatically generates a printable Transfer Manifest (like a delivery receipt) detailing the items, batches, and remaining shelf life for the receiving LGU's acknowledgment. Confirmation Tracking: Includes a field to record the Transfer Status and receive confirmation/acknowledgment from the receiving LGU once the stock is physically delivered.  |
| **Inventory Management Module (Item listings, adjustments and movements)** |

Disperse Medicines (First OUT): GSO staff scans the Barcode/QR of the retrieved medicine to automatically deduct stock and provide real-time levels. (This is the *dispensing* scan, distinct from the *receiving* scan). FEFO Logic Integration: The system automatically checks available batches and directs staff to pick the item with the closest expiration date first. Stock Life Cycle: Manages the entire life of the batch: Expired Medicines tracking, Quantity Difference logging, and Status updates. Internal Movement/Audit: Implements all Inventory Actions and Ledger functions (Withdraw, Return, Dispose, Set Physical Count).  |

## **Project Details**

| Project Name: | WellSync \- Dalaguete Rural Health Unit Medical Records and Inventory Management System |
| :---- | :---- |
| Date:		 | 10/3/2025 |
| Creator: | HITS Team |
| Version Number: | 1 |

| Project Overview |
| :---- |
| WellSync is a digital platform designed to be the internal inventory and medical record system for the Dalaquete Rural Health Unit. The project aims to replace manual, labor-intensive, and error-prone processes by connecting and automating essential services. The RHU currently faces challenges that impact its ability to deliver optimal services: **Inventory Management** The current process for tracking and counting medicines is manual, labor-intensive, and prone to errors as these are being counted, taken note of and encoded manually which can lead to difficulties in accurate stock counts, managing shelf life, and generating timely reports. The current system relies on manual counting, Excel sheets, and an external system (eLMIS) that is not fully integrated or utilized due to lack of training and outdated data. **Record Archiving** Although they have iClinicSys, it was mentioned by the RHU head that it lacked maintenance and upgrades and they still have a room full of physical folders that are used to store an estimated 70,000 patient medical records and profiles. This manual archiving system makes searching for individual records difficult and time-consuming, and there is a risk of records being lost. **Accreditation and Reporting** The RHU has faced issues with accreditation processes and generating reports for third-party entities like PhilHealth and DOH due to limitations of iclinicsys and a lack of integrated data.  ![][image1] ![][image2] |

| Purchase Request |
| :---- |
| This module enables RHU departments (Medical Staff) to formally request medicines and supplies from the GSO or Administrative staff, initiating the procurement process and identifying the requesting unit as a cost center. Main Screen/Page Displays: List of Pending/Approved/Completed PRs PR Creation Interface (Department Lookup) Supplier lookup Item Lookup for faster medicine search Status Tracker (Requested, Approved, Denied, PO Created) Each Purchase Order (PO) Will Include: PR Number PR Date Requesting Cost Center (e.g., Department, Ward, Program) Supplier Details: Supplier Name, Contact Info, Payment Terms, Tax details Created by and Approved by (User-in-charge) Remarks List of Items Requested (Medicine Name, Quantity, Unit) Functionality Details: Request Initiation: Allows Medical Staff or other RHU personnel to digitally request the purchase of medicines or office supplies. Cost Center Identification: Allows the RHU to identify the requesting department (e.g., Ward A, TB Program, or Admin Office) as a separate cost Center for internal tracking and budget allocation. Approval Workflow: Initiates an automated workflow for the RHU Head or GSO/Admin Staff to review, approve, or deny the request. Procurement Linkage: Approved Purchase Requests automatically feed into the Vendor/Supplier Management (Phase 2\) & PO Generation module to streamline the procure-to-pay process. |
| **PO Generation** |
| This feature enables the GSO/Admin staff to formalize and approve medicine reorders, linking them to defined stock thresholds.  Main Screen/Page Displays: List of Pending PO Drafts/History PO Generation Interface (Supplier Selection) Item Lookup for faster medicine search Inventory Check Status (Stock Order, Pending POs) Reorder Items Button (for items below threshold) Each Purchase Order (PO) Will Include: PO Number (Auto-generated) PO Date Supplier Details: Supplier Name, Contact Info, Payment Terms, Tax details Created By and Approved By Remarks List of Items for Purchase (Medicine Name, Quantity, Unit)  |
| **Warehouse Receiving Report (WRR)** |
| This feature formalizes the receiving process and implements Barcode/QR scanning for medicine stock, enforcing the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) confirming that the physical stock scanned matches the approved Purchase Order. This is a one-time event that happens before the stock is active. It ensures a three-way match (PO, Supplier Delivery Receipt, and Physical Scan) for audit and accounting purposes. Main Screen/Page Displays: List of Posted POs available for Receiving WRR Creation Interface (Link to PO and Barcode Scan) Discrepancy Calculator (Scanned vs. PO Quantity) Inventory Addition Confirmation (based on discrepancy calculation) Each Warehouse Receiving Report (WRR) Will Include: WRR Number (Auto-generated) PO Date PO Number Supplier Name  Supplier Number Total Amount Created by Action button: Receive Order PO Number Location Date Received Received By Items (can also be for barcode scanning) Item Ordered quantity Unit Total received quantity Remaining quantity to receive Expiration date Received quantity Remarks  Recent logs Each PO will consist of the ff details (dropdown): Requisition Slip  Expected delivery Approver(s) Supplier Location Date Received and Received By (GSO Staff) List of Items Received  Item Name Quantity Unit Unit Price Discount% Expiry Date Subtotal Discount Total PO Amount Recent logs Remarks Approval process can either be set to  required or bypassed   |
| **Stock Issuance (consignment from one LGU to another)** |
| This module manages the formal transfer of medicine stock from the originating LGU (Dalaguete RHU) to a receiving LGU. It ensures transparency, minimizes waste from expiration, and formally removes the stock from the WellSync inventory for audit purposes. Main Screen/Page Displays: List of Available Expiring Stock (Filtered by Expiry Date) Transfer Out Generation Interface (Recipient LGU Lookup) Real-time Stock Deduction Confirmation Tracking Status (Draft, Approved, Issued, Received) Print/Export Transfer Manifest Discrepancy Log (Transfer vs. Actual Issue) Each Transfer Out Record (TOR) Will Include: TOR Number (Auto-generated) Date of Issuance/Transfer Transferring LGU (Dalaguete RHU) and Receiving LGU (Name, Contact) Approver(s) (RHU Head, Admin) Total Value of Transferred Stock Each Transfer Item Record Will Include (Linked to TOR): Item Details: Item Name, Item Code Batch Information: Batch/Lot Number, Expiration Date, Remaining Shelf Life Quantity: Quantity Transferred, Quantity Requested Source Data: Original PO/WRR Number (for audit trail) Remarks  on the physical condition of the item upon transfer. Functionality Details and Technical Context: Transfer Initiation: Allows GSO/Admin Staff to create a Transfer Out Record (TOR) by selecting a receiving LGU and pulling data from the Expiring Stock Alerts list (from Stock Monitoring Dashboard). Stock Selection (FEFO Principle): The system ensures that only stock nearing expiry (FEFO logic) is eligible for transfer, with preference given to stock closest to the predetermined expiry alert threshold (e.g., less than 6 months). Item Pull/Issuance: GSO Staff uses the Barcode/QR Scanner to scan the specific medicine batches being pulled for transfer. This action immediately deducts the stock from WellSync's active inventory. Transfer Approval Workflow: Requires approval (e.g., from the RHU Head) before the Transfer Out Record can be finalized and the stock physically moved. This ensures accountability. Transfer Manifest Generation: Automatically generates a printable Transfer Manifest (like a delivery receipt) detailing the items, batches, and remaining shelf life for the receiving LGU's acknowledgment. Confirmation Tracking: Includes a field to record the Transfer Status and receive confirmation/acknowledgment from the receiving LGU once the stock is physically delivered.  |
| **Inventory Management Module (Item listings, adjustments and movements)** |
| This module implements Barcode/QR scanning for medicine stock, enforcing the First-Expired, First-Out (FEFO) principle to ensure inventory accuracy and minimize expiration waste. This module is active every day. It handles the medicine's life ***after*** it has been formally added to stock and tracks its movement out of the RHU. Main Screen/Page Displays: Date and Time, Medicine Item Name, Item Sub-Type Medicine Item Name Item sub-type (donated/supplied) Transaction type (Warehouse receiving/Stock Issuance/ Stock Issuance Receiving) Reference Number (WRR/SI/ADJ/SIR) Remarks Received By Expiration Date Beginning Quantity and End Quantity, Quantity Difference Status (Active, Dispersed, Expired) Location (Physical Storage) Action (Disperse, View History, Stock Issuance, Physical Count) Created by Approved by Each Batch Record Includes: Item Name and Unique ID Date Received Batch/Lot Number Expiration Date Current Stock Quantity Supplier/Vendor ID Created by Approved by Functionality Details and Context:  Stock Data Acceptance: Receives confirmed batch data from the WRR module to add stock to the active inventory ledger. Disperse Medicines (First OUT): GSO staff scans the Barcode/QR of the retrieved medicine to automatically deduct stock and provide real-time levels. (This is the *dispensing* scan, distinct from the *receiving* scan). FEFO Logic Integration: The system automatically checks available batches and directs staff to pick the item with the closest expiration date first. Stock Life Cycle: Manages the entire life of the batch: Expired Medicines tracking, Quantity Difference logging, and Status updates. Internal Movement/Audit: Implements all Inventory Actions and Ledger functions (Withdraw, Return, Dispose, Set Physical Count).  |
| **Patient Profile & Records Digitization Module** |
| This module replaces the physical folders by creating a secure, searchable digital repository for all patient information. Main Screen/Page Displays: Patient Unique ID Full Name Date of Birth Registration Status (Active, Inactive) Action (View Profile, Add/Edit Record, Search) Each Patient Profile Includes: Demographic Info (Full Name, Address, Contact) Medical History (Diagnosis and Prescriptions) Medications (Integrated with WellSync Inventory) Appointments Uploaded Documents (Scanned Records, Lab Results) Functionality Details and Technical Context Patient Profile Management \- Creates and manages digital profiles, including demographic and contact information. Medical Records Digitization \- Physical records are scanned and indexed (key data like Patient Name, DOB, Diagnosis are manually entered) to associate them with the digital profile. Staff can add/edit/remove new medical records directly. Data Migration \- The patient profile will use a separate database. Existing patient data from iClinicSys will be imported initially via CSV to avoid double entry, until a direct API integration is possible. (TBD if iClinicSys can generate the necessary Excel file). Advanced Search and Retrieval \- Enables searching by Patient Name, ID number, and Date of Birth, eliminating manual folder searching. Secure Storage and Access \- Implements secure digital storage and role-based access control (e.g., Doctors, Nurses, Admin Staff) to ensure data privacy and compliance. Note: Possible integration with a service like Billbird for:  Fraud Prevention (detecting altered uploaded medical records)  Automated Data Extraction (reading and extracting key data from scanned medical records). |
| **Core Reporting Module** |
| This module ensures key stakeholders can access and export essential data for audit, compliance, and decision-making. Main Screen/Page Displays: Report Type Selection (Inventory, Patient) Custom Report Builder Export Options (Printable, CSV) Stakeholder Integration Status Each Report Will Include: Date Filter (From/To Data Type Selection Inventory: Received, Dispersed, Expired Items Medical Records: Patient Demographics, Record Activity Functionality Details and Technical Context Inventory Management Reports \- Generates reports on inventory activity over specified periods. **Integrated to the Mayor’s office, Accounting, and Treasury Depts.** for general overview and audit. Medical Records Reports \- Generates reports on patient demographics and record activity, filterable by date range. Custom Report Builder \- Allows stakeholders to create custom reports by selecting data type, date range, and format for specific requests.
